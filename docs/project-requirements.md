### Preliminary Project Requirements Document: BPO Automator

#### Executive Summary
This document outlines the preliminary requirements for building BPO Automator, a Micro-SaaS using E2B-powered AI agent swarms to automate repetitive outsourcing tasks (e.g., invoicing, data entry) for emerging-market fintech SMBs. The focus is on a lean MVP with ≤3 core features, enabling quick validation and revenue in 30-60 days. Requirements are categorized for clarity, drawing from your stack (React/Framer Motion on Vercel, Supabase DB, E2B for agents, Azure/GCP serverless). Assumptions: 2-week build sprint with your 20 hrs/wk; PLG self-serve onboarding; no regulated data initially. Non-goals: Advanced analytics, mobile app, or multi-tenant enterprise features. Success metrics: TTV <5 min, 50% cost reduction demo-able in pilots.

#### 1. Functional Requirements
- **Core Workflow Automation**: Support ingestion of natural language task descriptions (e.g., "Process this invoice PDF: extract amount, validate against Stripe, email confirmation") via a simple text input form; coordinate multi-agent swarm on E2B to handle subtasks (e.g., extraction → validation → output).
- **Task Execution & Output**: Agents must process common BPO tasks like data entry from PDFs/emails, invoicing generation, and basic compliance checks; deliver outputs via email/Slack integration or dashboard download, with audit logs for each step.
- **User Onboarding & Management**: Self-serve signup with email/password (via Clerk or Supabase Auth); basic dashboard showing task history, usage stats, and one-click task submission; freemium limits (e.g., 50 tasks/mo free).
- **Integrations**: Minimal: API hooks for Stripe (invoicing) and Gmail/Outlook (email ingestion); webhook support for real-time notifications.
- **Billing & Limits**: Integrate Stripe for $99/mo subscriptions; enforce usage tiers (e.g., rate limiting on tasks) with upgrade prompts.

#### 2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance & Scalability**: Agent tasks complete in <30 seconds average; handle 100 concurrent tasks per user at scale; use Vercel's edge functions for low-latency in emerging markets.
- **Security & Compliance**: Encrypt all PII in transit/rest (Supabase defaults); basic GDPR-like privacy policy; no storage of sensitive data beyond task duration; role-based access (user-only initially).
- **Reliability & Error Handling**: 99% uptime SLA; graceful degradation (e.g., queue failed tasks); email alerts for errors; idempotent agents to retry on failures.
- **Usability**: Intuitive React/Framer Motion UI with <3 clicks to submit a task; responsive design for desktop/mobile; onboarding tour showing a sample workflow in <2 min.
- **Observability**: Log key events (task_started, swarm_completed) to PostHog/Sentry; simple dashboard metrics (e.g., tasks processed, cost savings estimated).

#### 3. Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js and Framer Motion for animations; hosted on Vercel with auto-deploys from GitHub; basic components: task form, history table, settings page.
- **Backend/Agents**: E2B for multi-agent orchestration (e.g., LangChain-inspired workflows); serverless functions on Vercel (Node.js) or Azure for API endpoints; Supabase for DB (tasks table with fields: id, user_id, description, status, output).
- **Data Model**: Tasks collection (id, user_id, input_text, agents_involved, output_json, created_at, status); Users table (id, email, subscription_tier, task_count).
- **Deployment & CI/CD**: Vercel for hosting/previews; GitHub Actions for lint/tests; environment vars for API keys (E2B, Stripe).
- **Testing**: Unit tests for agent logic (Jest); end-to-end with synthetic data (e.g., mock PDFs); manual checklist for onboarding flow.

#### 4. Risks & Mitigations
- **Agent Accuracy**: Hallucinations in unstructured data; mitigate with validation agents and user feedback loop in MVP.
- **Integration Stability**: API changes; use wrappers with error retries.
- **Cost Overruns**: AI usage spikes; cap at $0.10/task and monitor via Vercel analytics.

#### Appendix: Prioritization & Timeline
- Must-Have (Week 1): Core task ingestion/execution, basic UI, auth/billing stubs.
- Nice-to-Have (Week 2): Integrations, error alerts, Framer polish.
- Validation Tie-In: Requirements support concierge pilots (manual swarm sims) before full build.

This is a preliminary list—refine post-validation signals. Total estimated effort: 40-60 hrs for MVP.

### Kill / Commit / Defer: Commit
Strong alignment with your skills and untapped BPO niche, with quick path to $5K MRR via PLG and emerging-market demand.

Single next action (≤30 min): Fork a basic Next.js starter repo on GitHub (e.g., vercel/next.js/examples/hello-world), connect it to your new Vercel account, and deploy a hello-world page to test the setup.
